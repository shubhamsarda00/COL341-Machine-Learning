# Assignment 0

In this assignment, **GFLOPS** (Giga/10^9 Floating point operations per second) have been plotted to compare a naive for loop based matrix multiplication with **numpy.matmul** function. As expected, numpy function massively outperforms the naive function.

### Libraries Required
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
